    value: |
      #### It seems your project is missing spec files, you should add some spec files to spec directory.
      If you already have spec directory with `*_spec.lua` files then problem is probably `working-directory` settings.
      `working-directory` should point to directory where `spec` directory is located.
      
      Example when you have tests in `/src/mystuff/spec` directory:
      ```
      - uses: mt-mods/mineunit-actions@master
        with:
          working-directory: ./src/mystuff
      ```

runs:
  using: docker
  image: Dockerfile
